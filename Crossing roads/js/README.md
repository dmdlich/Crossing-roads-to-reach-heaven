This project is about the arcade game consisting of a grid, one player and three enemies.
Rules are simple, three enemies are crossing the grid _(x)_ and you, **the player** have to also cross the grid (y) from bottom to top without colliding with the emeny to beat the game.
To move the player, you can use the arrow keys and that's everything you need to play the game.
The speed in which enemies cross the grid are different everytime, so be careful not to collide with them!
